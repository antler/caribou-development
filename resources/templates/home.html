      <h1>Get {{verbed}}</h1>
      <p>
        Caribou provides a fully functioning site immediately, with selectively chosen conventions.<br />  
        But the beauty is that when you want to expand and alter this basic setup, nothing gets in your way.<br />  
        All the tools are there, but nothing is imposed upon you.<br />  
        Build exactly what needs to be built with robust and flexible building blocks.
      </p>

      <h1>Visit the Admin</h1>
      <p>
        Caribou comes with an admin for managing not only your content, routing, users and permissions,<br />
        but also the Models which define what attributes and relationships your content has.<br /> 
        You can find it here: <a href="/_admin/login">caribou admin</a> (user:pass caribou:caribou)
      </p>

      <h1>Create some Pages</h1>
      <p>
        Pages link the routing structure of the site to the controllers and templates that render them.<br />
        Controllers are written in <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.<br /> 
        Templates by convention use <a href="http://github.com/antler/antlers">Antlers</a> (which we developed out of a mustache base directly from the needs of several projects)<br /> 
        But you can swap it out with whatever you want!
      </p>

      <h1>Create some Models</h1>
      <p>
        If all you need is to render some static templates, you're done.<br />  
        But most likely there is data.  <br />
        What does your site keep track of?  People?  Projects?  Stories?  Videos?<br />
        In the admin you can build models of your data and create associations between models.<br />
        This way the organization of your data reflects real world relationships, and can adapt to needs as they change.<br />
      </p>

      <h1>Add Content</h1>
      <p>
        With your models in place, create some things!<br />
        Did you make a Person model with a name and an address and a mugshot?<br />
        Add a couple in the admin!
      </p>

      <h1>Visit the API</h1>
      <p>
        Now that you've made some models and content, you can access it all directly from the built in API: <a href="/_api/model">built in API</a>:<br />
        The scheme is simple:  
        <ul>
          <li>/_api/:model shows all instances of a given model.</li>
          <li>/_api/:model/:id shows a particular instance.</li>
          <li>/_api/:model/:id?include=:association gathers all content associated through :association.</li>
        </ul>
        For example: <a href="/_api/model?include=fields.link&order=id">/_api/model?include=fields.link&order=id</a>
      </p>
